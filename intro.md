# Introduction

Welcome to the demonstration companion Jupyter Book for:

**Living Planet Symposium 2025**  
**C.01.25 DEMO — DGGS: Scalable Geospatial Data Processing for Earth Observation**

---

## Objective

This demonstration introduces the DGGS (Discrete Global Grid System) framework, designed to enable efficient, scalable processing and analysis of large Earth Observation (EO) datasets.

DGGS leverages hierarchical grid structures and modern data formats like Zarr to improve data accessibility, processing speed, and analytical capabilities.

## What You'll Find in This Demo

- **Introduction to DGGS:**  
  Get a brief overview of the DGGS framework and how its hierarchical grid system can efficiently handle large-scale geospatial data.

- **Application to EO Data:**  
  See how DGGS can transform and process EO datasets, enabling improved storage, access, and exploration.

- **Visualization and Analytics:**  
  Learn about basic visualization and analytical tools available within the DGGS framework, supporting EO data analysis and discovery.

- **Future Potential:**  
  Explore the possible future applications of DGGS, especially for climate monitoring and large-scale environmental data workflows.

---

**Target Audience:**  
This demo is for Earth Observation scientists, geospatial analysts, and anyone interested in scalable solutions for environmental data processing.

**Format:**  
The demo will guide you step-by-step through DGGS features, with explanations and hands-on code cells. A Q&A session will follow for further discussion.
